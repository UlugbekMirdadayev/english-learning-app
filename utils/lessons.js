      "● The first road vehicles were powered by steam. In 1769, Nicolas Joseph Cugnot, a French engineer and mechanic, built a steam carriage for transporting cannons. It travelled about 3 mph (5km/h) and had to stop every 10 minutes to build up steam.• Before 1801, many people in the UK travelled around in carriages pulled by horses. Then Richard Trevithick found a way of making steam engines much smaller, and he put one of these engines on a carriage. His new “horseless carriage” was called the Puffing Devil.• Nicolaus August Otto was the German inventor who, in 1876, built the first four- stroke internal combustion engine, the prototype of the hundreds of millions that have been built since then. The Otto engine ran on a compressed mixture of gas and air, and it became the first practical and successful replacement of the steam engine. In 1885, a German mechanical engineer Karl Benz designed an built the world's first practical automobile which was powered by an internal-combustion engine. On January 29, 1886, Benz received the first patent for a gas-powered vehicle. It was a three-wheeler; Benz built his first four-wheeled car in 1891.• In 1885, Gottlieb Daimler, a German mechanical engineer, along with his design partner, Wilhelm Maybach, improved Nicolaus Otto’s internal combustion engine. They made it small, lightweight, and fast. They also developed a carburettor that made possible the use of gasoline as fuel.• Another type of internal-combustion engine was introduced by RudolfDiesel, also of Germany, in the early 1890s. Named for its inventor, the diesel engine was more efficient than engines of the Otto variety and was fuelled by heavy oil, which is cheaper and less volatile than gasoline.• Henry Ford incorporated the Ford Motor Company in 1903. He is known as the father of the modern assembly line. The assembly line reduced production costs for cars by reducing assembly time. Ford's famous Model T was assembled in ninety-three minutes.",

    title: "The Interior.",
    reading:
      "Have you ever wondered about the inside of a car and what makes it a comfortable and functional space? Let's take a closer look at the various components that make up the interior of a car. Seats: When you open the door and step into a car, one of the first things you notice is the seats. Cars typically have two front seats for the driver and a passenger, and additional back seats for other passengers. These seats are designed to provide a comfortable and supportive place to sit during your journey. Dashboard: Directly in front of the driver is the dashboard, which is like the command center of the car. The dashboard houses important instruments and controls. You'll find the speedometer, which tells you how fast the car is going, and the fuel gauge, indicating how much gas is left. The dashboard also contains controls for lights, air conditioning, and other features. Steering Wheel: The steering wheel is a large, round device located in front of the driver's seat. It allows the driver to control the direction of the car. Turning the steering wheel to the left or right guides the car on the road, making it an essential part of driving. Gear Shift: Situated between the front seats, the gear shift is a lever used by the driver to select different gears. Gears play a crucial role in determining how fast the car goes and are essential for a smooth driving experience. Windows: Cars have windows on the sides and front that can be rolled down to let in fresh air. There are buttons near the driver's seat to control the windows, allowing for easy adjustments. Windows provide a view of the surroundings and contribute to the overall comfort of the car's interior. Mirrors: External mirrors, positioned on both sides of the car, help the driver see what's happening behind and beside the vehicle. Adjusting these mirrors is important for safe driving, allowing the driver to be aware of their surroundings. Radio and Controls: Many cars are equipped with a radio for entertainment. The radio allows passengers to listen to music, news, or other broadcasts. Additionally, there are controls on the dashboard for air conditioning, heating, and other features to create a pleasant environment inside the car.",

      "Cars are like big puzzles with many pieces that fit together to make them work. Let's talk about the main parts that make up a car! 1. The Frame - Like a Skeleton Every car has a frame, which is like a skeleton. It holds everything together. The frame has parts like the suspension (which helps with bumps) and the wheels that make the car move. 2. The Body - The Outer Shell The body is like the car's outer skin. It keeps you safe inside and makes the car look cool! Cars can be made from strong materials like metal or tough plastics. 3. The Engine Room - Where the Magic Happens Imagine the engine room as the car's heart. It has the engine, which is like the car's super-strong muscles. The engine makes the car go vroom-vroom! There are other parts here, too, like the transmission, which helps control how fast or slow the car moves. 4. Inside the Car - Where You Sit Inside, you find seats, a dashboard, and a steering wheel. It's like your comfy space. The dashboard has buttons and gauges to control and check things. The steering wheel helps you turn the car where you want to go. How Everything Works Together The frame helps distribute the weight of the car evenly, so it doesn't wobble. Cars are also made to keep you safe. They have special parts that protect you if there's a crash, like airbags. When you drive, the car's body is designed to slide through the air smoothly, kind of like a superhero flying. This helps the car use less fuel and move better. So, a car is like a big team of parts working together. Each part has a job to do, making cars not just cool to look at, but also safe and ready to take you on adventures! As time goes on, cars will keep getting even cooler with new and exciting features!",

      "Fundamental parts of the engine are: cylinder, piston, connecting rod and crankshaft. Cylinder. The ideal form, consists of a plain cylindrical barrel, in which the piston slides, the movement of the piston or “stroke”, being in most cases, somewhat longer than the bore, but tending to equality or even less. This is known as the “stroke -bore ratio”.The upper end consists of a combustion or “clearance” space, in which, the ignition and combustion of the charge takes place.Cylinder size. Before deciding on the cylinder size and the number of cylinders the engineer will need to know how much power is wanted.For example, if the need is for 100 hp (horse power), it can be developed by one cylinder engine, having a cylinder of sufficient size. Or the same power can be developed by a 16-cylinder engine, having much smaller cylinders. If the engine is to be used for a stationary power plant, the choice might be one or two cylinders. If the engine is intended for use in automobile, it would be better to use 6 or 8 cylinders of smaller size. The smaller cylinders would have smaller pistons, rods etc., and as the parts are much lighter the engine can operate at higher rotational speed for a gain in power.Of course it must be remembered, that many improvements have been made in engine design in the past years. Today we often in about four times the power from a given size engine that we did thirty years ago. The bore, of the engine is not the sole determining factor in the amount of power that the engine will produce. Neither is the speed at which the engine operates is the determining factor.Many things need to be taken into consideration. Piston displacement is a reliable figure for indicating the potential power output of the engine. Piston displacement is the number of cubic inches of space, displaced by the cylinder away from the crankshaft. The cubic inch displacement of an engine can be obtained mathematically from the dimensions",

      "GM Uzbekistan is a joint venture between the Uzbek OJSC UzAvtosanoat (75%) and the American General Motors Company (25%) for the manufacturing of automobiles, and is located in Asaka, Uzbekistan The JV originally was founded in 1996 between the Uzbek government and the South Korea-based Daewoo, and was initially known as UzDaewoo Auto. Following the change of ownership of Daewoo to GM Daewoo, the facility was renamed GM Uzbekistan in 2008 to continue to produce Uz-Daewoo branded vehicles. More recently these models are now sold as Chevrolets as in other international markets.GM Uzbekistan began production on 27 November 2008. The first assembled car on this day was a Chevrolet Lacetti which also was the 1,000,000 assembled vehicle out of the production from UzAvtosanoat. The annual production of GM Uzbekistan are 250,000 units. Since the beginning of the third quarters Chevrolet is manufacturing the Chevrolet Spark M300 in Asaka. The M300 is currently intended only for export. Currently, the models are assembled CKD and SKD kits. But GM Uzbekistan plans to manufacture up to 50% of all needed parts and want to realize it soon as possible. Another plant is producing 200,000 units of front- rear- and side windows for the vehicles of the Uz-DaewooAvto and the Chevrolet Lacetti. In 2010, about 5,000 employees were employed at the GM Uzbekistan assembly plant. GM Uzbekistan sold 121,584 vehicles locally in 2011, making the country the eighth-largest market for Chevrolet and produced more than 225,000 vehicles. In 2012, the Chevrolet Cobalt was added to the production line.Look at the pictures and write about Uzbek cars.",

    title: "The Internal Combustion Engine",
    reading:
      "The Internal Combustion Engine Internal combustion engines ignite fuel to create useful mechanical energy. Most engines have a tank that holds fuel. Fuel pumps from the tank into chambers called cylinders. An engine’s cylinders are located between its head and its engine block. Valves control the flow of fuel into and out of the cylinders. Each cylinder contains a piston which can move up and down the cylinder. Piston rings form seals between the pistons and the walls of the cylinders. When fuel enters a cylinder, the piston rises. This compresses the fuel at the top of the cylinder. When this happens, a spark plug ignites the fuel. The explosion makes the piston shoot down the cylinder. This, in turn, pushes a connecting rod. The connecting rod then turns the crankshaft in the crankcase. The turn of the crankshaft outputs mechanical energy. A sump with lubricating oil keeps the engine parts running smoothly",

    reading:
      "One modern dictionary defines an engine as any mechanism or machine designed to convert energy into mechanical work.There may be steam engines, internal combustion engines, etc.A steam engine is an external combustion engine, as the fuel is burned outside it. An internal combustion engine burns the fuel inside the engine cylinder to produce expansion which is turned into power. Heat is a form of energy, and all automobiles are equipped with some form of heat engine.The source of the energy may be coal, wood, petroleum products, etc.For convenience, it is usually petroleum products in the form of gasoline,gas or oil.Any of these materials can be used to generate steam for a steam engine. For internal combustion engines natural gas can be used.Petroleum is the dominant fuel today for every source of motive power, as the heat energy can be converted directly from the fuel into power by burning it in a cylinder.In a steam engine the fuel is burned to create steam from water and the steam furnishes the expansive force for the engine. Many steam automobiles were built in the early years of the automobile. The steam cars used kerosene to heat the water to make steam and also used a small quantity of gasoline to maintain a tiny flame in the pilot, which initiated combustion of the kerosene.Now the steam engine is rarely used in automobile business, but it is still in the use in locomotives and in other power installations.",

The fuel is pumped into carburettor bythe fuel pump. The carburettor is a device for turning petrol into gas and mixing it with air in the correct proportions. The carburettor is attached to the inlet pipe. The explosive petrol-air mixture is sucked into the engine's cylinder through the inlet pipe. Then it is compressed by the piston. Gas is exploded by an electric spark inside the cylinder at the point of the sparking plug.When all the work is extracted from the gas, the exhaust valve opens and the burnt gas escapes through the exhaust pipe into the air.",

    title: "PLASTIC ENGINE PARTS",
    reading:
      "To decrease an automobile's weight, and thus improve its fuel efficiency, more and more parts are now made of plastic— but usually not critical engine components. Because of high stress and heat most engine parts are still made of metal. Now, in Britain, an intake manifold — the engine-block attachment that feeds air and fuel from the carburetor to the cylinders — has been molded from plastic. Its developers are Fibeiglass, Ltd., of St. Helens, Merseyside, BTR Permali RP, Ltd., of Gloucester, and Ford Motor Co. Ltd., of Essex. The new manifold is believed to be the first major plastic engine component ever to be designed for production automobiles. It is made by polyester compound — called X52 — and is shaped exactly like an aluminum manifold currently used on the Ford Cortina's 1.3-liter engine. Since this part has a series of intricate, twisting interior chambers, a new molding technique had to be devised. The trick is to form the plastic around metal cores inside a mold. Once the manifold is set, or cured, it is placed in a hot oil bath that melts the metal cores, leaving the required hollow chambers. The 21/2 -pound plastic manifold weighs 25 per cent less than a metal one.But its importance goes beyond this minor reduction. According to its developers, the manifold's special plastic compound and the new molding technique may represent breakthroughs leading to additional lightweight engine parts, as well as products for other industries.",

    title: "PISTON",
    reading:
      'The usual form of piston for an internal combustion engine is an inverted bucket-shape, machined to a close (but free sliding) fit in the cylinder barrel. Gas tightness is secured by means of flexible "piston-rings" fitting closely in grooves turned in the upper part of the piston.The pressure of the gases is transmitted to the upper end of the connecting rod through the "gudgeon pin" on which the "small end" of the connecting-rod  is free to swing.Conventional pistons for internal combustion engines are shaped like a bucket, but many variations in the specific design are possible. They are usually made of cast iron or aluminium, carry three or four piston rings and may be flat, concave or convex on the outer surface of the closed end.The piston pin may turn in the piston and be anchored in the upper end of  the connecting rod. Engine pistons serve several purposes; they transmit the force of the explosion on the crankshaft through the connecting rod they act as a guide for the upper end of the connecting rod, they also serve as a carrier for the piston rings used to seal the piston in cylinder.Pistons operate under exceedingly difficult mechanical and thermal conditions and therefore must be made and installed with the utmost care. They must be strong enough to stand the force of the explosion and yet be as light as possible to avoid excessive inertia forces when their direction of travel is reversed twice each revolution.As they must slide freely within the cylinder they cannot be fitted too tightly. If too closely fitted in the cylinder they will knock and rattle.Pistons are made of cast iron and semi-steel. This material is strong enough for the stresses imposed, it has a melting point above the cylinder operating temperature, expands at the same rate as the cylinders and does not generate excessive friction when properly lubricated. The principal objection is that of weight.Aluminium is also used as a material for pistons. It is lighter than castiron. Between the piston and cylinder a certain amount of clearance is pro 44 vided. The amount of clearance depends upon the design of the engine cylinders and cooling system, the piston design and material and to a certain extent the service conditions under which the engine operates. Surface treatment will also have a bearing on the piston clearance.The clearance between cylinders and piston is measured in most саsеs by means of a feeler gauge inserted between the piston and cylinder.',

    title: "Camshaft",
    reading:
      "A camshaft in its simplest form is a straight shaft with an eccentric lobe or cam on it. For one cylinder four cycle poppet valve engine it would have two cams on it -one for the inlet valve and another for the exhaust valve. These cams would be located at different places around the perimeter of the shaft as the valves need to be opened at different times. For a multiple cylinder engine there are ordinarily as many cams as there are valves to be operated. The cam is designed to lift the valve at precisely the correct instant of piston travel and hold it long enough to obtain the most efficient filling and emptying of the cylinder and thus exerts considerable control over the volumetric efficiency of the engine. In any car engine the ram of the cams are designed to open the valve smoothly and gradually.The location of the cams around the camshaft along with the design of the crankshaft determines the firing order of the engine. At one time cams were pinned or keyed to the crankshaft, but they are now forged in one piece and it is not possible to get them mixed up. When they are worn out of shape, it is necessary to replace the entire camshaft.",
